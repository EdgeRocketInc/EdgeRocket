                    <img class="img-thumbnail img-blog" src="../../img/box-in-nature.jpg" alt="The New Landscape of Learning" width="250px" align="left">
<p class="p1">Several years ago, I worked for a technology company - I was part of the consulting team.  Unfortunately, the company’s formerly rapid growth had recently begun to decline (sharply), and the executive team made a big and not-very-fun decision: shed the consulting team that I was a part of, and focus on the core technology business.  Many of my consulting colleagues were let go.  A few of us were invited to stay on in a different position.  For me, that meant moving from consulting into a product management role.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had never done product management at a technology company.  But I thought it’d be a good opportunity, so I went for it.  I knew the industry and our product.  My (new) boss was smart and helpful.  And I was an avid learner, so I figured I could get up to speed in short order.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So I began to do research on product management.  I spent many hours entering queries into Google’s search box to identify articles, books, and other materials to help me master my new trade.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What I discovered was that great resources were few and far between.  Sure, I did find a handful of useful materials.  I bought a few books from Amazon (including <i>Inspired</i> and <i>The Product Manager’s Desk Reference</i>), and they were very helpful.  I read a few dozen articles, which helped to fill in some knowledge gaps.  I got information from the websites of product management industry associations (including AIPMM, SVPMA, PDMA).  And, of course, I had numerous meetings and conversations with my boss and colleagues about our activities.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But overall, my knowledge quest was frustrating.  I wanted more.  I needed more details on product management approaches, and more specific examples from experienced product managers at great companies.  What are the most effective ways to conduct customer interviews?  How should I interact with the internal teams I was working with?  How can I influence and manage people that don’t report to me?  Even though I was hungry and ready to invest whatever time and energy necessary to learn, there just was not enough high-quality, expert material available.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I dived in and did everything I could to acquire the most needed knowledge and skills, and was able to ramp up reasonably well, and make good progress on the company product initiatives.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But here’s the point: I could have contributed in a much more significant way if I had had access to better learning resources and latest-and-greatest information on product management.  I was playing a pivotal role, helping to guide a major turnaround of our business.  Our team was making critical decisions about our products and strategy, and we were re-directing the company's staffing plans and work activities.  More in-depth product management content would have deepened our understanding, given us more ideas for specific tactics, and helped us achieve better outcomes.      </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fast forward to today.  If a similar situation occurred now, and if I were that same consultant transitioning into a product manager role, I could access a wealth of learning resources - most of them available online.  Not all of these resources are easy-to-find or good - in fact there is a lot of crappy, time-wasting content.  But with some exploration, you can find excellent learning resources by product management pros.  And these learning resources can directly contribute to enhanced performance and results. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Learning resources” is vague, so let me be specific.  Here is a list of short courses, articles, videos and other information that would have been extremely useful to me as I was undergoing my job transition years ago:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to these items, I would have taken some technology courses to enrich my technical knowledge, and to help me communicate more effectively with our engineering team.  I likely would have chosen a variety of courses from Coursera, edX, Treehouse, or Code School.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The “curriculum” listed above would have represented a meaningful time investment.  It’s a lot of material.  But</span> having access to these resources - taking the courses, reading the articles, watching the videos - would have made a major difference in my effectiveness.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My plight a number of years ago illustrates a profound transformation that has occurred: today there is an amazing array of online courses and resources that enable people to acquire valuable knowledge and job skills.  Whether you just took on a new role in your career, or you’re sharpening your skills to better execute your current responsibilities - you have an unprecedented arsenal of resources available to help you learn, grow, and succeed.</span></p>
