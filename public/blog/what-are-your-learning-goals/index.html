<p class="p1">

Holiday season is upon us.  As you close out 2014 and begin the new year, it’s a perfect time to reflect on many parts of your life, and to think about the future.  
</p>
<p class="p1">

The fast-approaching month of ‘January’ is named for the Roman god Janus, who was known as the god of new beginnings. Janus is depicted, in ancient myths, as having two faces: one looking back to the past, the other looking forward to the future. The image is emblematic of one of the common rituals of January, making New Year’s Resolutions. 
</p>
<p class="p1">

Many people focus their New Year’s Resolutions on things like losing weight and saving money.  Certainly, these goals are virtuous...even if the rate of successfully achieving them is rather low.   But what if you set different goals this year?  How about making learning part of your resolutions?  
</p>
<p class="p1">

For some people, learning or development goals are part of their performance management process at work.  If this process is already in place for you, it can be a great mechanism for focusing on learning goals.  
</p>
<p class="p1">

But far too many people don’t have specific goals or plans for their learning and growth.  They leave it up to chance.  They have vague intentions of improving their professional skills or re-invigorating their career, but they fail to actually commit to anything specific.  And they stop short of creating the dedication, accountability, and support systems required to succeed.    
</p>
<p class="p1">

More than ever before, you need to be deliberate about setting learning goals.  The world is moving at an incredibly fast pace, and you need to keep growing to stay at the top of your game.
</p>
<p class="p1">

Additionally (and interestingly), new research has shown that learning goals have some advantages over performance goals.  For example, if you have a goal of increasing your personal sales revenue, setting learning goals (acquiring deeper product knowledge, improving your presentation skills), can be more effective than setting a performance goal (closing 10 deals per quarter).  While different goal-setting parameters can be productive in different situations, setting learning goals tends to tap into a potent source of motivation and engagement that drives strong results.    
</p>
<p class="p1">

How do you set effective learning goals? A great starting place is to look to the previous twelve months – just like the face of Janus looking to the past.  As you look back on the year-that-was, did you find yourself in a situation where a knowledge gap or skill deficiency reduced your ability to contribute? And then look ahead to the upcoming year.  In both your personal and professional life, what new knowledge or skills will make you more formidable and bold?  What will take you to the next level?
</p>
<p class="p1">

Making a list of your learning goals and prioritizing them is a productive next step.  Think about both small goals (getting more adept at social media, improving your basic finance or spreadsheet skills) as well as big ones (mastering a complex product or industry knowledge, attaining certification in project management or programming or data science).
</p>
<p class="p1">

A few other critical factors to consider are time (how much time is required to learn and how will you fit it in your schedule?), people (who can help you achieve your learning goal?), and learning materials (will you read books, take online classes, etc.?).  A tool like EdgeRocket is perfect to help find excellent learning materials.

We’ll cover more specific goal-setting principles in our next <a href="/blog/7-tips-to-set-smart-learning-goals">post</a>.  For now, don’t leave your learning and growth to chance.  Set aside time over the holidays to consider: what are your learning goals for 2015?
