Continuous learning fuels job performance.  Whatever your role, you have to stay up to date, deepen your expertise, and acquire new skills in order to deliver exceptional results.  
</p>
<p class="p1">

On a company-wide level, supporting the learning and growth of your employees is a powerful way to increase engagement, retention and performance.  
</p>
<p class="p1">

But most companies are highly mediocre at promoting learning.  Why?  “We’re too busy right now” is the usual response, along with “people can hopefully find what they need on their own.”
</p>
<p class="p1">

Yes, your team is always learning through their everyday work and conversations, and by sharing content they come across.  But elite athletes don’t improve their performance merely by playing in games and scrimmages.  They take a deliberate approach, with systematic assessment and focused practice in all areas of their game.  You and your team should adopt a similar strategy to your skill building and development.  
</p>
<p class="p1">

There are countless ways to encourage learning within your company.  Some initiatives require planning and implementation.  Others are fairly simple, and require little more than communication and follow-up.  Here are 6 smart things you can do to optimize learning and growth.
</p>
<p class="p1">

<ol>
<li class="li-blog">
Communicate the expectation that all employees need to learn and improve.  One company that does this well is Zappos, where one of the core values is “Pursue Growth and Learning.”  Zappos has a company reading list with more than 30 books available to employees at no charge, and a handful of courses on ZapposU that employees are encouraged to take (on topics like company culture, spreadsheets, and giving presentations). 
</li>
<li class="li-blog">
Set quarterly learning and development goals.  Ideally, this should be part of the quarterly performance management conversation that managers have with employees.  Review what you learned last quarter, and what professional development you plan to work on in the upcoming quarter.  Like with your business goals, record your specific learning objectives in writing - whether in a talent management system, or a simple document or email sent to your boss.  Follow up at your next quarterly meeting.   
</li>
<li class="li-blog">
Host internal training sessions.  These may be lunch-and-learns, training sessions, or other informal learning events.  Pick timely and important topics, and bring in outside speakers or get internal subject matter experts to lead them.  As Ben Horowitz says in The Hard Thing About Hard Things, “Take your best people and encourage them to share their most developed skills.  Training in such topics as negotiating, interviewing, and finance will enhance your company’s competency in those areas as well as improve employee morale.”  Broadcast these sessions via web conferences for remote employees, and archive them in an easily retrievable place for future viewing. 
</li>
<li class="li-blog">
Advise employees about valuable courses, programs, and certifications.  These may be local, in-person classes.  Or they may be online courses offered by course providers  such as Udemy, Pluralsight, Coursera, Lynda, etc.  Regularly notify your team and company about these opportunities by email and internal postings, and encourage group participation to amplify the positive results.      
</li>
<li class="li-blog">
Set a budget.  Many enterprises have some formal training budgets and tuition reimbursement programs in place (typically for degree-seeking programs).  But you also should include - as part of the training and development budget - a designated sum that people can use for courses, books, or seminars of their choosing.  (Maybe manager input/approval is required.)    
</li>
<li class="li-blog">
Make learning social.  Most companies have social networks where they exchange updates and content.  Take this to another level by capturing the most valuable learning recommendations and making them easy to find and use.  Create playlists of valuable articles and awesome blog posts.  The company Buffer buys all new employees a Kindle Paperweight and Kindle books, and Buffer employees share which books they’re reading (including CEO Joel Gascoigne, who was working on Socrates and Great by Choice by Jim Collins).  
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="p1">

There are numerous other ways to support employee development - mentoring programs, book clubs, hackathons, etc.  But implementing these 6 strategies will give you a foundation for a continuously-learning, energized, high-growth culture.
