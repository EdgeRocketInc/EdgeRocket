<p class="p1">
It's one of the major questions raised about online courses: does the class qualify for "official" credit?  And the follow up inquiry: if the online course doesn't count for credit, will my employer (or a potential employer) take it seriously?
</p><p class="p1">
The concern is understandable.  In some cases, people are working toward a degree or certification and need to take accredited courses.  Or in some situations, employees can only have costs reimbursed if the class is a formal degree-seeking course.
</p><p class="p1">

Accreditation is a hot topic.  Until recently, very few online courses counted for official academic credit.  Whether the classes are of the "MOOC" variety from providers such as edX, Coursera or Udacity, or if they are online classes from Lynda, Udemy, Skillshare or others -- most don't qualify for credit.
</p><p class="p1">

That's beginning to change.  A limited number of Coursera and Udacity courses have been approved for credit from the American Council of Education, one of the predominant credentialing institutions.  And the smart money says that this trend will only continue.  As online course administration and testing improves, legitimate online courses taught by qualified professors or other experts will be accredited.  But it may take a while to get there.  And outside of the courses taught by full professors from prestigious universities, there are many hundreds or thousands of online courses -- this includes long lists of classes on important career skills (selling, negotiating, growth hacking, hiring) and software applications or other technologies (Excel, Photoshop, Python, Ruby, databases) -- that aren't considered academic courses and will likely never be eligible for official degree credit.
</p><p class="p1">

Obtaining academic credit, however, does not actually apply to the majority of potential course takers.  And if academic credits aren't relevant for your goals, then don't waste your time worrying about it.  Not to get too idealistic, but the main value of the course should be the learning itself.  The principal benefit should be an enhanced capacity to perform great work, whether that is coding a mobile app, creating an infographic, building financial statements, or gaining whatever knowledge or skill you took a class about.
</p><p class="p1">

So if you're in a job interview or performance review discussion, should you discuss the online classes you've been taking?  How can you get "credit" for a course if it doesn't offer official credit?
</p><p class="p1">

Well, first, many online course providers do supply you with a "certificate of completion" if you complete the class and any associated assignments and tests.  In fact, several sites (edX, Coursera, Udacity) have recently begun to offer a higher-level "verified certificate," which adds a layer of validation.  So these completion certificates may be useful if you want to make the certification more formal -- and many of the certificates from top course providers can easily be uploaded to your LinkedIn profile.
</p><p class="p1">

But the larger answer is, if you're discussing online coursework in a job interview or performance appraisal, you can talk about the classes you've taken the same way you do for any experience you've undergone.  If it was a valuable learning experience that has deepened your knowledge and capabilities, then specify to your interviewer or boss what you learned and how you're better and more qualified than you were before.  If you completed a project in the course -- such as a coding project, a sharply designed video, a sample marketing strategy, or something else worthy of display in your portfolio -- then bring it up and show it off.  And while it's somewhat self-evident, consider explicitly making the point that taking online classes demonstrates your lust for excellence, and your commitment to continuous improvement.  Some of the classes can be so interesting that you can simply and genuinely tell a little story about who the instructor was, why the class was so great, and relate a few gems from the class.  (If it's an important conversation or interview, plan these discussion points in advance.)
</p><p class="p1">

As you'd expect, when you get further along in your career, the fact that you recently took an online class isn't going to add much to your long, distinguished resume that is full of major accomplishments.  But especially if you're younger, or if you need a fresh new project to fill a skill gap or spice up your qualifications, then these class project items can work extremely well.
</p><p class="p1">

No matter what your age or qualifications, taking great online classes will expand and deepen your powers.  You'll be able to create a better presentation, or design a better product, or take a new approach to your leadership style.  So unless you really need the credits in the bank, then don't be overly concerned about it.  Take great classes so you can learn, grow, and prosper.
