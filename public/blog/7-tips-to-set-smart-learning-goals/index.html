Last post covered why learning goals are so important.  This post gets practical, offering 7 tips to help you set smart learning goals and take your performance to a new level.  The tips come from (1) learning science, and (2) best practices for effective goal-setting.  
</p>
<p class="p1">

Why is it so important to be deliberate and strategic with your learning goals?  Most people have general intentions to improve their skills and advance their career -- whether you want to get better at giving presentations, project management, selling, finance, html, or mastering your company’s new product.  But face it: you’re busy as hell.  If you don’t smartly prepare your learning goals, they ain’t gonna happen.  If you truly want to deepen your knowledge or acquire new skills, you have to create a plan.  
</p>
<p class="p1">

Here are 7 tips to help you create smart learning goals:
</p>
<p class="p1">

<ol>
<li class="li-blog">
Target high-value skills.  Start by considering the specific knowledge and skills that will have a big impact on your work performance and career.  What are new capabilities that -- if you acquired them -- would propel your achievements?  Create a clear and compelling picture of how you’ll be more effective. Frame it as a stirring narrative, so you’ll remain motivated and persistent through the required work and practice.  
</li>
<li class="li-blog">

Calibrate intelligently.  Depending on your current career and life status, the learning goals you choose might be aggressive and audacious, or they might be relatively modest.  Maybe you’re ready to tackle a new career path or pursue a challenging industry certification.  On the other hand, maybe your job demands are utterly hectic right now, and the best you can realistically do is to upgrade practical competencies (e.g., enhance your social media competence, management skills, etc.).  
</li>
<li class="li-blog">

Combine learning and doing.  Get involved in an event or project that helps you practice what you’re learning.  Say you want to improve your presentation skills, and you’re going to read a book and take an online class on the subject.  Well, in addition, volunteer to lead a presentation or webinar (or multiple presentations!) in a month or two, so you can put your concepts into practice.  Learning knowledge in the abstract -- without real-world application -- is almost a waste of time.  Taking the step to practice your skills in real situations dramatically increases your learning effectiveness.  Do it.  
</li>
<li class="li-blog">

Share your learning goals.  You may already have a process at work where you collaborate on development goals with your manager.  Whether you have this type of formal process or not, share your learning goals with your boss, colleagues, and family.  If possible, recruit knowledgeable mentors or subject matter experts to help you.  This step enlists others in your learning journey, and boosts your accountability. 
</li>
<li class="li-blog">

Get real.  For most people, squeezing in time to learn something new means squeezing out time for some other activity. Explicitly identify what obstacles and sacrifices are required to accomplish your learning objectives.  What barriers will you run into?  What will you have to give up?  By identifying these trade-offs upfront, you can plan around obstacles and increase your success.
</li>
<li class="li-blog">

Record your learning goals, with all relevant details.  What is your specific plan to learn new subjects or skills?  Most the advice around setting "SMART" goals is solid -- write out how your learning goals are Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Results-oriented, and Time-bound.  Record learning goals in your company’s performance management system, use other online goal-setting apps, or simply use a word document or notebook.  Set reminders and alerts, and schedule sessions to review progress and results.  Keep your plan lightweight and simple, but set up a structure that helps you hold yourself accountable. 
</li>
<li class="li-blog">

Identify superb teachers and learning materials. Will you be enrolling in a local class, or purusing online classes and materials?  There is an amazing wealth of online courses, books, and other learning content available.  (Using a site like EdgeRocket is a great place to start.)  Especially because you are so busy, you don’t have time to mess around with crappy learning materials.  And don’t be afraid to pay for exceptional learning resources.  Or better yet, get your company to pay for it as part of your professional development budget.  This is one of the most important investments you’ll make, and you won’t follow through if you’re dealing with boring, low-quality learning content.   
</li>

</ol>

</p>
<p class="p1">

Setting your learning goals each quarter or year should be required for everyone. Continuous learning is simply necessary to help you grow, contribute, and win.  And while it can require additional commitment, it helps keep work interesting and exhilarating.  Stay strong and have fun!
