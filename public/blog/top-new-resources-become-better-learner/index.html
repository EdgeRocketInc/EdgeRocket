Working and learning have become inseparable.  
</p><p class="p1">

A few decades ago, it was different.  Jobs didn’t change very much.  Workers received initial training, and they performed their defined tasks for years.  Today, job demands compel people to acquire new knowledge and master new skill sets.  Working is learning, and learning is working.  And you have to be a great learner to be a great performer. 
</p><p class="p1">

As Stephanie Tilenius (who has worked at Google, eBay and Kleiner Perkins) says in the book Talent Mandate: “It is all about being a learning human being.  The people who are most aggressive about learning new skills and trying new things will be the most successful.” 
</p><p class="p1">

Most career-related courses or books are about a specific business topic or technical skill, such as marketing, coding, spreadsheets, or leadership.  But recently, there has been heightened interest in the process of learning — the scientific evaluation of learning and skill acquisition, and the discovery of techniques to help people and companies improve their learning effectiveness.  It’s an especially exciting field right now because of recent advances in brain science and online learning technologies.
</p><p class="p1">

Below is a list of terrific resources published in the last year — books and online courses — to help you and your team become better learners.
</p><p class="p1">

Some of these resources are particularly useful for HR, Talent Management, and Learning & Development professionals.  But they are valuable for anyone who wants to learn more effectively and achieve more success.
