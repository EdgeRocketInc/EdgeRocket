EdgeRocket
==========

EdgeRocket source

Branches:
* master - everything (keep in mind that web/edge_app is split into heroku branch, but is not kept up-to-date, so don't check in there
* master-heroku (subtree of edge_app directory in master branch) - for pushing to Heroku, because it needs a root of the tree for some reason
