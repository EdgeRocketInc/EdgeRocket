Branches:

Historically this repo started in master branch, and then it was split into master-branch using git tree split. Currently here are these branches:

* master - contains scripts and services
* master-heroku - contains the Rails web app for pushing to Heroku, because Heroku needsed it in the root of the tree for some reason
