                    <img class="img-thumbnail img-blog" src="../../img/Education-orange-graphic-1024x775.png" alt="Navigating The Online Learning Universe" width="250px" align="left">

<p class="p1">You need to learn a new skill -- or improve an existing one -- so you can achieve bigger and better things at work.  It could be any business or technical skill, such as giving presentations, web development,  data science, negotiation, or spreadsheets. You're considering taking an online class.  But there are a beaucoup courses and content -- sometimes dozens of different offerings on the same topic -- and it takes forever to figure out what's good and what's not, how much each costs, how much time it will take, and what the course entails.  Is it just watching videos?  Homework, tests, and certifications?  Interacting with other students or teachers?  Is it easy or rigorous?</p>
<p class="p1">Or as yet another option, you could bypass a formal online course and take an informal path -- just checking out YouTube videos, articles and blog posts about the topic.</p>

<p class="p1">So how can you effectively navigate this vast online learning universe, and find the content and instruction that's best for you?</p>
<p class="p1">Well, first, let's quickly say that <em>this is amazing</em> -- there has never been a time in history with so much access to so many learning resources that can help you acquire new knowledge and skills, and build an exciting career and life.</p>
<p class="p1">Now back to the issue: it's no easy task to find the great content that matches your objectives.  In the last couple of years, scores of online learning companies have emerged.  It's a wide wide world of online training and education, and it's challenging to concisely summarize it and provide guidance.</p>
<p class="p1">But the EdgeRocket team is just the type to take that challenge.  We've created a basic list to help you understand the contours of the online learning universe, with important parameters you should consider when selecting your path.  Of course, this is a gross overgeneralization, many details are omitted, and people could quibble with some of the characterizations.  But this overview is a good place to start, and can hopefully serve as a useful guide.</p>
<p class="p1">Before beginning your search, start by looking inward at your goals and resources.  How much time and money can you devote to learning your topic?  Are you disciplined enough to complete a course on your own, or do you prefer support and accountability?  Is online the right medium for you and your goals, or would an in-person course be better?  Once you've set your basic goals, begin to navigate with the information below.  The list is organized by intensity level -- from higher-intensity, formal courses to lower-intensity, informal content.  (We decided not to include courses or certifications provided by industry associations, conferences, or product training by enterprise software companies.)</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Long courses with personal support.</strong>  Many of these courses cover technical skills like programming, web development, data science, or digital marketing.  Typically, they run for a few months in calendar duration, and require 10-20 hours of study and project work per week.  And this specialized segment includes a mentor or tutor for each student (usually you meet with your tutor for an hour per week or so, in order to get expert feedback and stay on track).  This is excellent for accountability and personalized attention...and as you might guess, you pay for it.  These courses are relatively expensive -- often a few hundred to a few thousand bucks for a
course on Ruby on Rails or web development.  Representative course providers include: Udacity, Thinkful, BLOC, DesignLabs, ThoughtBot.</li>
    <li><strong>MOOCs</strong>.  If you haven't heard this term yet, the acronym stands for Massive Open Online Courses.  MOOCs are often taught by University professors or other experts, and follow an academic model transported online.  Many business and technology topics are covered, as well as other traditional college curriculum subjects.  Here's where generalizations are difficult, because there is wide variety of MOOCs.  Some are free, some are a couple hundred bucks, and some (like Coursera and edX) offer a premium-level "verified certificate" for about $50.  Some are self-paced, and others have a specific start and end date.  If it's a scheduled course, a MOOC will typically run for 1-3 months, and require anywhere from 5-12 hours of work per week.  The curriculum usually includes a combination of videos, reading, projects, online discussion, quizzes.  Representative course providers include: Coursera, edX, NovoEd, MIT-OCW, HBX, Canvas Network, FutureLearn, ed2go, and MarketingProfs.</li>
    <li><strong>Online skill classes</strong>.  Again, the focus is typically on business and technical topics, such as digital marketing, management topics, software training, graphic design, web development, and coding.  Usually, these courses are self-paced, and can contain anywhere from a few hours to up to 60 hours of content...many courses are in the range of 12-20 hours of material.  They are typically priced on a monthly subscription basis, such as $29 or $49 per month.  Some include quizzes and projects, and offer a "certificate of completion" if you pass quizzes or a test.  Representative course providers include Treehouse, Udemy, Lynda, Codecademy, Code School, Pluralsight, Skillfeed, FrontendMasters, O'Reilly.  There's a related number of digital marketing courses provided by companies such as Google, HubSpot, Marketo, Eloqua, Moz, and others.</li>
    <li><strong>Short courses/videos/recorded webinars</strong>.  Now we're transitioning away from what most people would consider a "course," and into the realm of short courses, webinars, or videos about a specific topic.  Some of these are free (Khan), some are available at a monthly subscription, others are payable per course.  Representative providers include General Assembly, Khan Academy, Grovo, tuts+, Udemy, UIE, Th
eNextWeb, growthhacker.tv.  Some YouTube and TED videos can fit in here as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Other online learning resources</strong>.  Here's the catch-all bucket for other online learning content.  It's a bit daft to include this as a category, because it could include any website with useful information, so it's an extremely broad array of content.  But we're including it, and we don't regret it.  Because it's worth mentioning the obvious point that, when faced with the need to improve your knowledge and skills in a certain area, sometimes you can improve more by reviewing a series of informal resources (say a number of articles, an eBooklet, YouTube videos, and Quora posts) than by taking a formal course.  As always, it depends on your goals and preferences, and how much good material there may be on the subject you're interested in.  In addition to relevant sources about your topic area, notable sites to explore include Google (duh), YouTube, Vimeo, SlideShare, Quora, Reddit, StackOverflow.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">So which learning resources are right for you?  Especially if you're tackling a fairly complex subject and long online course (and/or if this represents a professional development goal you're sharing with your boss), you need to carefully evaluate your options.  This isn't just a 2-hour movie from Netflix or even a book from Amazon (which typically takes 4-7 hours to read).  If you're taking a challenging course, you may be spending 6 hours per week for 10 weeks or so...for a total of 60 hours!  Do the research beforehand to make sure you're getting a great payoff.</p>
